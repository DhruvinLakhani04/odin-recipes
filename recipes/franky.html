            <li>wheat</li>
            <li>potato</li>
            <li>green chutney</li>
            <li>chopped onions</li>
            <li>pickled green chilies</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl add flour, salt and enough water to form a semi soft dough.</li>
            <li>Add oil and knead the dough properly. Cover it and let it rest for minimum 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl add chopped green chilies, vinegar and salt. Mix and keep aside for further use.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a pan on medium heat and add minced garlic-ginger-chili. Sauté for a minute or till the raw smell of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
            <li>Now add asafetida/hing, red chili powder, frankie masala, turmeric powder, mix well. Add tomato ketchup, mix and sauté for 20-30 seconds on low flame.</li>
            <li>Now add the mashed potatoes, chopped coriander and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Mix well and switch off the flame.</li>
            <li>To make patties beforehand, place patties in a wide pan, grease lightly with oil and cook until they turned golden brown from both sides. Patties are ready to use.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough again to smooth out and divide into 4 equal balls.</li>
            <li>On a dusted board roll out each portion into a thin 9-10-inch chapatti.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle/tawa and lightly cook chapatti on both sides. Grease with a very little oil on both sides. Chapattis are ready to make roll.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, if you are planning to make chapattis beforehand and serve later, skip the greasing part. Stack and cover the chapattis with damp cloth. Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Don't cook the chapatti completely otherwise while assembling the wrap they will get very crisp and dry.</li>
            <li>Get everything ready before assembling frankie.</li>
            <li>Heat griddle/flat pan on medium heat. Add some butter/oil, then place half cooked roti and cook it from both sides. Place patty on the side to warm it up if made beforehand.</li>
            <li>Now place the roti on a work surface, place potato patty, sliced/shredded onion, cabbage and carrot, sprinkle some frankie masala, chili vinegar and roll it tightly. Cover the frankie ½ way through with parchment paper or butter paper.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!!!</li>
